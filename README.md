# livecode-at - Live-Coding Audiotool with JavaScript

A contribution to our little, internal Nexus SDK hackathon.

The Idea is to be able to live-code pattern-devices with JavaScript. Future Ideas could include
adding effects, modifying parameters, and so on.

Once we can access time information through the Nexus API, things will REALLY start to become interesting
because then we might be able to add time-based modifications (i.e. "every 2 bars, reverse the pattern").
